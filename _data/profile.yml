description:  I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/">Haverford College). I received my PhD Computer Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in 2021, where I had the honor to be advised by Prof. [Pedro Felzenszwalb](cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/). I earned my Masters degree in Computer Science at [University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis](unice.fr) under Prof. [Marc Antonini](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~am/Biography.html). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at [Federal University of Ceara (UFC)](http://www.ufc.br) under Prof. [FÃ¡tima N. S. de Medeiros](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5144730275745518). <br> <br> I am broadly interested in unsupervised problems in Computer Vision and Data Science. In my current research, I am interested in using discrete optimization and statistics to tackle Image Segmentation. Previously, I studied problems involving Subspace Clustering, Semidefinite Programing and Belief propagation. In my undergrad years, my research focus was on SAR Image Segmentation and Level Sets.
