description:  I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/). I received a PhD in Computer Engineering and a Masters in Applied Mathematics from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in 2021, where I had the honor to be advised by Prof. [Pedro Felzenszwalb](cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/). In 2015, I earned a Masters degree in Computer Science at  [University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis](unice.fr) under Prof. [Marc Antonini](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~am/Biography.html) and prior to that I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at [Federal University of Ceara (UFC)](http://www.ufc.br) under Prof. [Fátima N. S. de Medeiros](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5144730275745518). <br> <br>  I am broadly interested in unsupervised problems in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In my current research, I am interested in using discrete optimization, statistics and deep learning to tackle Image Segmentation and Clustering. Previously, I worked on machine learning problems involving Probabilistic Graphical Models and Semidefinite Programming. In my undergrad years, my research focus was on Synthetic Aperture Radar and Biomedical Image Segmentation using Level Sets.

        description: Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, image searches to self-driving cars. On the other hand, Deep learning has shaken the world of artificial intelligence in the recent years. Most of these developments greatly advanced the performance of state-of-the-art visual recognition systems, which put Computer Vision in the epicenter of most technological progress from the past decade. In this context, this course aims at providing a consistent exploration of how deep learning started to its most recent achievements, always using Computer Vision tasks as their main application, historically or practically. During the course, we'll also understand many of the main computer vision problems and use them as cases for the introduction of various deep learning related problems. Finally, this course hope to give students working knowledge of PyTorch, one of the main deep learning frameworks, and prepare them to future industrial and academic careers in the field.
